# BetterUnitCorrector

Designed to be an improvement and replacement for [UnitCorrector](https://github.com/Wendelstein7/DiscordUnitCorrector).

Converts between SI and non-SI units by reading, transforming, and quoting user Discord messages with measurements of many sorts in them.

## Planned Features

- [ ] conversion from Non-SI -> SI for various units *(eg 3000 miles -> 4828 km)*
- [ ] conversion from SI -> Non-SI for various units *(eg 4828 km -> 3000 miles)*
- [ ] multiple conversions per message (both ways?)
- [ ] multiline conversions
- [ ] nicely-rounded multiplications
- [ ] handle and respect numbers with commas *(eg 3,000 miles -> ~4,828 km)*
- [ ] commands for manual conversion
